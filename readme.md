# Enhanced Brick Kiln Compliance Monitor

This project provides an enhanced compliance monitoring tool for brick kilns across different states in India. It features detailed compliance analysis based on proximity to kilns, hospitals, and water bodies with interactive visualization in the form of maps and plots using Folium and Matplotlib, integrated in a Gradio dashboard interface.

## Features

- Load multiple CSV datasets including brick kilns, hospitals, and waterways.
- Assign kilns to states using GeoJSON state boundaries.
- Compute compliance violations based on configurable distance thresholds.
- Visualize detailed compliance status with interactive maps, pie charts, scatter plots, and bar charts.
- Generate detailed state-wise summaries and downloadable datasets.
- Flexible user interface built with Gradio for ease of use.

## Project Structure

In future releases, the project directory will include the following folders:

```bash
data/ # This folder will contain all CSV files such as kilns, hospitals, waterways, etc.
india_shapefiles/ # This folder will contain GeoJSON files for Indian state boundaries
```

- Place all CSV datasets required for the application inside the **data/** folder.
- Place all GeoJSON files representing Indian states inside the **india_shapefiles/** folder.

The application will be updated to automatically detect and use files from these folders.


## Installation

Make sure Python 3.8 or above is installed.

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the application with:

```bash
python app.py
```
Use the interactive Gradio web dashboard to upload data files, adjust compliance thresholds, and view results.

## Data Sources and Input Format

### Data Sources

The current version uses source data primarily from:

- **OpenStreetMap (OSM):**  
  A collaborative, community-driven initiative providing detailed geographic data contributed worldwide. Using the Geofabrik platform, geometry data for railway tracks, highways, rivers, schools, and habitations was extracted with filters applied as listed below (Table 1). These spatial features support the distance-based compliance monitoring in the app.

  | gis_osm_railways_free_1.shp      | Railway tracks    | No filter                                  |

- **Government Data:**  
  Geolocation data for approximately 165,000 hospitals and nursing homes was obtained from the Indian Governmentâ€™s open data portal.

- **Brick Kiln Dataset:**  
  A brick kiln dataset is available on Kaggle:  
  [Brick Kiln Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/3eb8e7201b14b158ed841718cb777c5b94a6a6375aaa8499c7376ec831f8d879)  
  This data can be used as input to the application.

### Input CSV Format

- **Kilns CSV:**  
  Must include at least these columns:
  - `lat`: Latitude in WGS84 coordinate system (decimal degrees)
  - `lon`: Longitude in WGS84 coordinate system (decimal degrees)  
  Additional columns such as kiln identifiers or attributes can be included.

- **Hospitals CSV:**  
  Expected columns:
  - `Latitude` and `Longitude` OR `lat` and `lon` (decimal degrees)  
  This data is optional but improves compliance distance checks.

- **Waterways CSV:**  
  Should contain points with columns:
  - `lat` and `lon` (decimal degrees) OR  
  - A `geometry` column containing WKT representations of LineString or MultiLineString features.  
  Waterways data supports compliance checks based on proximity to water bodies.

- **State Boundaries:**  
  Drop GeoJSON files representing state boundaries into a specified folder. The app will automatically load and use these for assigning kilns to states.

## Upcoming Enhancements

- UI/UX improvements for a more intuitive and responsive dashboard.
- Upload functionality enhancements for seamless data input.
- Additional visualization and export options.
